You always wanted more options in your country's government, if yes, this mod is for you.

This mod is a agroupment and adjustment of three of my favorite mods, so go there to check them (Because i don't deserve all the credits): 
Extended Government Laws - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1835918659
Hearts of Iron: New World Order - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=726036596
Government Characteristics Updated - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2856568669

Some logos are created using Paradox Hearts of Iron IV icons.

Most of the icons used Ultimate-HOI4-GFX from Globvs :
